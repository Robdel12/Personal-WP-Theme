	<h2>Built with <strike >love</strike> LESS (and SCSS)</h2>
	<p><a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less & SCSS</a> are CSS Pre-processers that allow you to use things like mixins, variables, functions &amp; variables, and many more things.</p>

	<h2>Lighter than anything else</h2>
	<p>Thumper is super light. It's actually lighter than anything I've ever used before. This is because Thumper is built to be text only. I've never  needed images, sprites, pre-made headers, or anything of the likes. Not even built in jQuery or any JavaScript. Thumper is meant for custom sites and lightness is the selling point.</p>
	<p>Thumper is so light because it's pretty much a CSS/LESS framework. It makes things super fast to get up and running and you'll love the simplicity of it.</p>
	<p>Don't take simplicity as a negative. If you're a control freak, like I am, you will have complete control of your code and will understand everything thats being used. Unlike other frameworks you might have some weird JS toying with your layout. (I've had that happen once, It wasn't easy to debug!)</p> 
	<h2>Infinite</h2>
	<p>Thumper isn't based on sixths, eighths, tenths, or twelfths. It's (technically) infinite. I say technically because once you get past one-twentieth the gutter (space separating the divs) becomes bigger than the content area.</p>
	<p><strong>Spacer divs</strong></p>
	<p>Thumper has this really cool thing I built into it. It allows you to create spacer divs in your grid. For example if you have a layout that requires two rows of three one-thirds and one row of one one-third and the last one needs to be centered you could just type: "< div class= "grid one-third space" >< / div>" and it'll fill a fourth of the page with empty "padding" area.</p>
